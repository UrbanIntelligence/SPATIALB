# SPATIALB 
## Spatial-Temporal Intelligence Evaluation Benchmark 
<img src="/logo.jpg" width="20%" >

We plan to develop a <b>SPA</b>tial-<u><b>T</b></u>emporal <u><b>I</b></u>ntelligence Ev<u><b>al</b></u>uation <u><b>B</b></u>enchmark (SPATIALB), that provides an evaluation framework with data, tasks, and metrics, to measure progress, catalyze innovation, and unite researchers around shared objectives in spatial-temporal AI, and fuel rapid advancement in this field. Our envisioned SPATIALB benchmark includes five major components: (1) tasks/competitions, (2) data, (3) evaluation metrics, (4) pre-training models, and (5) fine-tuning models. 

Our preliminary results were published in ICDM 2023, entitled "Self-supervised Pre-training for Robust and Generic Spatial-Temporal Representations", authored by Mingzhi Hu, Zhuoyun Zhong, Xin Zhang, Yanhua Li, Yiqun Xie, Xiaowei Jia, Xun Zhou, and Jun Luo.

Prof. Yanhua Li (Data Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute)

Prof. Zhe Jiang (Computer Science at University of Florida)

Prof. Yiqun Xie (Geospatial Information Science at the University of Maryland, College Park)

Prof. Xianfeng Yang (Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park)

Prof. Alireza Khani (Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo-Engineering at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities)

Prof. Xin Zhang (Computer Science at San Diego State University)
