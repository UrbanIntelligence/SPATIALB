# SPATIALB 
## Spatial-Temporal Intelligence Evaluation Benchmark 
<img src="/logo.jpg" width="20%" >

We plan to develop a <span style="color: red"><u><b>SPA</b></u></span>tial-<u><b>T</b></u>emporal <u><b>I</b></u>ntelligence Ev<u><b>al</b></u>uation <u><b>B</b></u>enchmark (\textsf{SPATIALB}), that provides an evaluation framework with data, tasks, and metrics, to measure progress, catalyze innovation, and unite researchers around shared objectives in spatial-temporal AI, and fuel rapid advancement in this field. Our envisioned \textsf{SPATIALB} benchmark\footnote{\textsf{SPATIALB} benchmark (Github repository) with our initial results~\cite{ICDM2023-ST-pretrain}: \url{https://github.com/yanhua-rep/SPATIALB}.} includes five major components: (1) tasks/competitions, (2) data, (3) evaluation metrics, (4) pre-training models, and (5) fine-tuning models as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spatialb} and further elaborated below.
